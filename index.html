                            <p class="lead">Hi! Im Stephen Jochen, I am originally from Lancaster, PA. I have lived all
                                over the
                                U.S.
                                but spent most of
                                my life in Montana. I moved to Richmond about 4 years ago to start a new job. I recently
                                left
                                that job to
                                start a coding class at the University of Richmond and have started brodening my coding
                                horizons.

                                I enjoy playing hockey, watching sports and doing various activities outside. I have
                                been
                                playing hockey
                                since I was a sophmore in highschool, I have always played golaie. Growing up I played
                                soccer
                                when I was
                                in elementary school and once I was old enough I played football. I have tried to keep an active life style and when ever I have down time I try to find something to do!

                                Now that I have moved to Richmond, I want to start focusing on my career. Finding a
                                career that
                                you like
                                is no easy task, lucky for me I may have stumbled upon a career I realy enjoy. I started
                                coding
                                late in
                                2018 and decided I wanted to see how I might be able to turn this into a career. I found
                                the U
                                of R
                                coding bootcamp and decided that this was the best place to kickstart my career!
